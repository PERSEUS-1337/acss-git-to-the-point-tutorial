# Space Station Data Encryption & User Authentication System

This is a collection of Python scripts that handle encryption of data and user authentication for the space station's computer system.

## Encryption

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the scripts to encrypt your data.

### Usage

To encrypt a file, run the `encrypt.py` script and pass in the file path as an argument:

```
python encrypt.py path/to/file
```

To decrypt a file, run the `decrypt.py` script and pass in the file path as an argument:

```
python decrypt.py path/to/file
```

**Note:** The key used for encryption and decryption is generated automatically and stored in the `key.key` file. Make sure to keep this file secure as it is required to decrypt the data.

## User Authentication System

### Files

- `auth.py`: Contains functions for hashing and checking passwords.
- `user.py`: Defines the `User` class for creating and authenticating users.
- `main.py`: Implements the user authentication system.

### Usage

To use this authentication system, follow these steps:

1. Import the `User` class from the `user.py` file.
2. Create a new user object by passing in a username and password.
3. Call the `authenticate` method on the user object, passing in the password to check.
4. Check the `is_authenticated` attribute on the user object to see if authentication was successful.

Example:

```python
from user import User

# Create a user
user = User('admin', 'password123')

# Authenticate the user
if user.authenticate('password123'):
    print('User authenticated successfully.')
else:
    print('Invalid username or password.')
```
